Required Inputs

* pay period = per calendar month
* gross-income = annual-salary / 12 months
* income-tax = calculated using annual-salary based on the tax table provided below
* net-income = gross-income - income-tax
* super = gross-income x super-rate

All calculation results rounded to the whole nearest dollar EXCEPT tax amounts
ie. 2669.5 rounded down to 2669 instead of to 2670
